# Detection of malicious injections using deep learing
in this small project , we tried to build a smart model who can analyse a incoming request from user and detect if the request is clean (human inputs:passwords,comments,emails etc..) or malicious( xss payload, sql injection payload) ,the architecture of the model contains LSTM neural network who can deal well with texts(sentiments analyse) and others stuffs.in general ,the model works well ( check confusion confusion matrix) specially for  detection of sql injections, but we have to improve the detection of xss because the is rare class for model, so we are trying now use some new skills: focal loss ,transfer learning.. to solve this small problem..
