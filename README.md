# Detection of malicious injections using deep learing
In this academic project , we tried to build a smart model that can analyse a incoming request from user and detect if the request is clean (human inputs:passwords,comments,emails etc..) or malicious( xss payload, sql injection payload) ,the architecture of the model contains LSTM neural network that can deal well with texts and others stuffs.in general ,the model works well ( check confusion matrix) specially for detection of sql injections, but we still have to improve the detection of xss because it's a rare class for the model, to achieve this objective we will use in the next version of the project the loss function "focal loss" that can force the agent to pay more attention for rare classes.
